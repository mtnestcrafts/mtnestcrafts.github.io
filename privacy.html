<p>Thank you for visiting MTNestCrafts! Your privacy matters to me...</p>
 and I want to be clear about how your personal information is collected, used, shared and protected.

This Privacy Policy applies to information I collect when you:

make a purchase from my shop

1. Who I am and how to contact me

MTNestCrafts

I am the data controller for the personal information described in this policy.

2. Personal information I collect and why

To fulfil your orders and run my business I may collect:

Contact details — name, address, email

Order details — product ordered, quantity, price

Payment information — handled by Etsy/third parties

Additional info if you contact me directly (e.g., for custom orders)

This information is collected:

Legal bases for processing include:

Your personal information may be shared in limited circumstances, including:

I do not sell or rent your personal information to third parties.

4. Data retention

I keep your information only as long as necessary to:

resolve disputes

In most cases this is no longer than 4 years, unless required by law.

5. Transfers outside the UK or EU

Your data may be processed by third parties located outside the UK/EU (for example, through Etsy’s systems).

Where this happens, appropriate safeguards are in place to protect your information.

6. Your rights

If you wish to exercise any of these rights, please contact me at the email above.

You also have the right to complain to “the UK Information Commissioner’s Office (ICO)”
