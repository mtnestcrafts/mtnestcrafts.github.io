  <h2 class="center-heading">Andrea</h2>


  <p>
    I’m Andrea, a recycler of rubbish and founder of <strong>MTNestCrafts</strong>,
    a small eco-focused business. I spend my time turning waste materials into
    beautiful gifts that have a use in the home.
  </p>

  <p>
    Back in 2010 I rescued a pile of shot glasses from the bin at a local cider festival.
    That was the beginning of my creative recycling journey. Influenced by the huge
    lanterns hanging in the trees at my favourite festival, I set about making miniature
    versions for my daughter’s campervan.
  </p>

  <p>
    They were a hit with friends who encouraged me to make more. Fast forward to 2016 —
    due to debilitating migraines — I retired from working as a TA in my local school
    and started my own small business turning waste materials into lovely gifts.
  </p>

  <p>
    This allows me to work when I am feeling well and not to feel so guilty when I
    can't. Fast forward to the present day and I am still here, making unique,
    vintage-style lampshade fairy lights and bottle lights — repurposing rubbish and
    saving plastic from landfill.

  <p>
    The husband, the dad, the practical one. Dependable, funny, kind — and endlessly
    patient with my constant hoarding of "useful" bits and crafty mess.
  </p>

  <p>
    When he’s not repairing lifeboats he is often found in his garage,
    beavering away…
  </p>

  <p><strong>Here are a few of his projects…</strong></p>

        We try to use as many recycled materials as possible and work closely with local businesses
        and neighbours who save items for us that would otherwise end up in landfill.
      </p>

      <p>
        From bottles and festival cups to paper, fabric and wood — every piece tells a story
        and helps reduce waste.
