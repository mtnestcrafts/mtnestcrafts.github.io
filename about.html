      <p>
        After our children had flown the nest — and we had decorated just about everything in sight —
        <strong>MTNestCrafts</strong> was born.
      </p>

      <p>
        Through our shared love of recycling and creativity, we came up with an idea to light up our campercar.
        What started as a fun project soon became something friends and family couldn’t stop asking for.
      </p>

      <p>
        Our unique, vintage-style <strong>lampshade fairy lights</strong> and <strong>bottle lights</strong>
        quickly grew in popularity, and before we knew it, MTNestCrafts became a small eco-focused business.

        We try to use as many recycled materials as possible and work closely with local businesses
        who save items for us that would otherwise end up in landfill.
      </p>

      <p>
        From bottles and festival cups to paper, fabric and wood — every piece tells a story
        and helps reduce waste. #waronwaste

        <h3>Dave</h3>
        <p>
          The husband, the dad, the practical one. Dependable, funny, kind — and endlessly patient
          with my constant hoarding of "useful" bits and crafty mess.
        </p>
        <p>Here are a few of his projects…</p>

        <h3>My Mum</h3>
        <p>
          The Grandma of MTNestCrafts — where the arty, crafty and musical genes come from.
          At 85 years old she is still creating beautiful things today.
        </p>
        <p>Here are some of her creations…</p>

        Every item we make is created slowly, thoughtfully and with sustainability at heart.
        Thank you for supporting handmade and helping us save things from landfill.
